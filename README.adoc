A counter-example finder for higher-order logic, designed to be used from
various proof assistants. A spiritual successor to Nitpick.
Documentation at https://nunchaku-inria.github.io/nunchaku/.

Nunchaku requires http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/web/[CVC4] 1.5 or later.
Alternatively, it can use other backends:

- https://github.com/c-cube/smbc[smbc], a solver written in OCaml, for computational logic
- kodkod with its https://github.com/nunchaku-inria/kodkodi-pkg[kodkodi frontend]
- Paradox (https://github.com/c-cube/paradox[snapshot here])

We have https://github.com/nunchaku-inria/nunchaku-problems[a set of problems]
for tests and regressions, that can also be helpful to grasp the input syntax
and see how to use the constructs of Nunchaku.

== Basic Usage

After installing nunchaku (see <<install>>) and at least one backend,
call the tool on problem files written in one of the accepted syntaxes
(<<supported-formats>>) as follows:

----
$ nunchaku docs/examples/first_order.nun
SAT: {
  type term := {$term_0, $term_1}.
  type list := {$list_0, $list_1}.
  val nil := $list_1.
  val a := $term_1.
  val b := $term_0.
  val cons :=
    (fun (v_0/75:term) (v_1/76:list).
       if v_0/75 = $term_0 then $list_0 else if v_1/76 = $list_0 then $list_1
       else $list_0).}
{backend:smbc, time:0.0s}
----

A list of options can be obtained by calling `nunchaku --help`. A few
particularly useful options are:

- `--help` for listing options.
- `--timeout <n>` (or `-t <n>`): maximal amount of seconds before returning "unknown"
- `j <n>` for controlling the number of backend solvers active at the
  same time.
- `--solvers s1,s2` (or `-s s1,s2`) for using only the listed solvers.
- `--debug <n>` (where `n=1,2,â€¦5`) to enable debug printing.
  The maximal verbosity level is 5, and it is very verbose. Consider
  using `nunchaku --debug 5 foo.nun | less -R` to not drown
  in pages of text.
- `--pp-all` (and each `--pp-<pass>`) for printing the problem
  after each transformation.
- `-nc` to disable colored output if your terminal does not support it..

== Contact

There is a dedicated mailing list at nunchaku-users@lists.gforge.inria.fr
  (https://lists.gforge.inria.fr/mailman/listinfo/nunchaku-users[register]).
The https://github.com/nunchaku-inria/nunchaku/issues[issue tracker] can be
used for reporting bugs.

== Documentation

See the website https://nunchaku-inria.github.io/nunchaku/
and link:/docs/index.adoc[the documentation sources].

[[install]]
== Build/Install

To build Nunchaku, there are several ways.

=== Released versions

Releases can be found on https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/nunchaku .

=== Opam

The easiest way is to use http://opam.ocaml.org/[opam], the package manager for
OCaml. Once opam is installed (don't forget to run `eval `opam config env``
when you want to use opam), the following should suffice:

    opam pin add -k git nunchaku https://github.com/nunchaku-inria/nunchaku.git#master

then opam should propose to install nunchaku and its dependencies. To upgrade:

    opam update
    opam upgrade nunchaku

Note that the binary is called 'nunchaku.native' until is it installed.

=== Manually

You need to install the dependencies first, namely:

- http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html[ocamlfind]
- https://github.com/c-cube/ocaml-containers/[containers]
- http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/[menhir]
- https://github.com/c-cube/sequence[sequence]
- https://github.com/c-cube/tip-parser[tip-parser] (which requires menhir)
- https://github.com/ocaml/dune/[jbuilder] (build system)

Once you have entered the source directory, type:

    make

[[supported-formats]]
== Input/Output/Solvers

Supported input formats are:

- nunchaku's own link:/docs/input_lang.adoc[input format], ML-like (extension `.nun`)
- TPTP (very partial support, extension `.p`)
- https://github.com/tip-org/[TIP] (extension `.smt2`)

Supported solver backends:

- http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/web/[CVC4] (at least 1.5, or development versions: we need finite model finding)
- Paradox (https://github.com/c-cube/paradox/[github clone (easy to install)];
  http://vlsicad.eecs.umich.edu/BK/Slots/cache/www.cs.chalmers.se/~koen/paradox/[official page])
- https://github.com/emina/kodkod[Kodkod] with its "kodkodi" parser
- https://github.com/c-cube/smbc/[SMBC] (`opam install smbc`)


=== How to make a release

- udpate the repository itself
  * edit `nunchaku.opam` to change version number
  * `git commit --amend` to update the commit
  * `git tag 0.42`
  * `git push origin stable --tags`

- make an archive:
  * tar.gz: `git archive --prefix=nunchaku/ 0.42 -o nunchaku-0.42.tar.gz`
  * zip: `git archive --prefix=nunchaku/ 0.42 -o nunchaku-0.42.zip`

- upload the archive on gforge, write some release notes, send a mail.
