= Nunchaku
:toc: macro
:source-highlighter: pygments

A counter-example finder for higher-order logic, designed to be used from
various proof assistants. A spiritual successor to Nitpick.
Documentation at https://nunchaku-inria.github.io/nunchaku/.

Nunchaku relies upon recent versions
of http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/web/[the CVC4 SMT-solver]. Currently it is
necessary to use unreleased versions of CVC4, that can be found
under "development versions" on http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/downloads/.

We have https://github.com/nunchaku-inria/nunchaku-problems[a set of problems]
for tests and regressions, that can also be helpful to grasp the input syntax
and see how to use the constructs of Nunchaku.

== Basic Usage

After installing nunchaku (see <<install>>) and at least one backend,
call the tool on problem files written in one of the accepted syntaxes
(<<supported-formats>>) as follows:

----
$ nunchaku docs/examples/first_order.nun
SAT: {
  type term := {$term_0, $term_1}.
  type list := {$list_0, $list_1}.
  val nil := $list_1.
  val a := $term_1.
  val b := $term_0.
  val cons :=
    (fun (v_0/75:term) (v_1/76:list).
       if v_0/75 = $term_0 then $list_0 else if v_1/76 = $list_0 then $list_1
       else $list_0).}
{backend:smbc, time:0.0s}
----

A list of options can be obtained by calling `nunchaku --help`. A few
particularly useful options are:

- `--help` for listing options.
- `--timeout <n>` (or `-t <n>`): maximal amount of seconds before returning "unknown"
- `j <n>` for controlling the number of backend solvers active at the
  same time.
- `--solvers s1,s2` (or `-s s1,s2`) for using only the listed solvers.
- `--debug <n>` (where `n=1,2,…5`) to enable debug printing.
  The maximal verbosity level is 5, and it is very verbose. Consider
  using `nunchaku --debug 5 foo.nun | less -R` to not drown
  in pages of text.
- `--pp-all` (and each `--pp-<pass>`) for printing the problem
  after each transformation.
- `-nc` to disable colored output if your terminal does not support it..

== Contact

There is a dedicated mailing list at nunchaku-users@lists.gforge.inria.fr
  (https://lists.gforge.inria.fr/mailman/listinfo/nunchaku-users[register]).
The https://github.com/nunchaku-inria/nunchaku/issues[issue tracker] can be
used for reporting bugs.

[[install]]
== Build/Install

To build Nunchaku, there are several ways.

=== Released versions

Releases can be found on https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/nunchaku .

=== Opam

The easiest way is to use http://opam.ocaml.org/[opam], the package manager for
OCaml. Once opam is installed (don't forget to run `eval `opam config env``
when you want to use opam), the following should suffice:

    opam pin add -k git nunchaku https://github.com/nunchaku-inria/nunchaku.git#master

then opam should propose to install nunchaku and its dependencies. To upgrade:

    opam update
    opam upgrade nunchaku

Note that the binary is called 'nunchaku.native' until is it installed.

=== Manually

You need to install the dependencies first, namely:

- http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html[ocamlfind]
- https://github.com/c-cube/ocaml-containers/[containers]
- http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/[menhir]
- https://github.com/c-cube/sequence[sequence]
- https://github.com/c-cube/tip-parser[tip-parser] (which requires menhir)
- https://github.com/ocaml/oasis/[oasis] (to build the development version, not releases)
- ocamlbuild (provided with OCaml ≤ 4.03)

Once you have entered the source directory, type:

    ./configure
    make

[[supported-formats]]
== Input/Output/Solvers

Supported input formats are:

- nunchaku's own link:/docs/input_lang.adoc[input format], ML-like (extension `.nun`)
- TPTP (very partial support, extension `.p`)
- https://github.com/tip-org/[TIP] (extension `.smt2`)

Supported solver backends:

- http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/web/[CVC4] (development versions, we need finite model finding)
- Paradox (https://github.com/c-cube/paradox/[github clone (easy to install)];
  http://vlsicad.eecs.umich.edu/BK/Slots/cache/www.cs.chalmers.se/~koen/paradox/[official page])
- https://github.com/emina/kodkod[Kodkod] with its "kodkodi" parser
- https://github.com/c-cube/smbc/[SMBC]
