# It would be nice if Nunchaku could handle this case by e.g. picking the
# first equation first (and, perhaps, emit a warning). These equations can
# occur in Isabelle -- but the user has to prove that overlapping equations
# coincide for their common values. This could be assumed in Nunchaku. Or we
# just say that it's a sequential semantics, like in ML. (Not that it would
# matter for the Isabelle or Coq frontends.
