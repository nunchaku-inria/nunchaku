# outcome: sat with wrong model
# expected: sat with right model

# The wrong model is
#
# SAT: {
#   val m := Suc zero.
#
# }
# It is doubly wrong: "even (Suc zero)" should be "false". And where are "even"
# and "odd"?

data nat :=

  forall (n : nat). even (Suc n) = odd n
and odd : nat -> prop :=

  forall (n : nat). odd (Suc n) = even n.

val m : nat.
