# outcome: sat, but without "alphabet-" in the SMT problem
# expected: sat

# "alphabet" occurs with positive polarity in the goal, and the right-hand
# sides of the "rec" equations of a symbol marked "+" should be done with a
# positive polarity, not with unpolarized. There is no reason why "alphabet-"
# should appear in the problem.
