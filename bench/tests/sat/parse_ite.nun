# outcome: "CVC4 error"
# expected: sat

# Two issues:
#
# 1. The "CVC4 error" is not a CVC4 error. It is a Nunchaku error because
#    Nunchaku cannot parse CVC4's output. This must be clarified. Otherwise,
#    it sounds as if the error message came straight from CVC4.
#
# 2. The parser needs to be generalized some more. (Ask Andy to find out once
#    and for all what's the output format.)
