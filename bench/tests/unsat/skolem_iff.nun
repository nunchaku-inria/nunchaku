# The bug appears to be in the skolemizer. The arguments of "if and only iff" are
# unpolarized, because "(P = Q) == ((P ==> Q) && (Q ==> P))" -- notice that P and Q
# occur both negatively and positively in the latter expression.
# The most precise way to deal with "iff" in terms of polarities is to expand it.
