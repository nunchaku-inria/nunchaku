= Syntax of Generated Models

The syntax for models is, by default, the <<native-syntax>>. Alternative
syntaxes can be picked with the `--output {nunchaku,tptp,sexp}`
(or, for short, `-o`) command line option.

[[native-syntax]]
== Native Syntax (`-o nunchaku`)

A syntax that is nice on the eyes, and mostly mirrors the input format.
For example, this is a model with one type and two constants:

----
SAT: {
  type a := {$a_0, $a_1}.
  val xs := Cons $a_0 Nil.
  val ys := Cons $a_1 Nil.
}
----

The output follows the following rules. `UNSAT`, `UNKNOWN`, or `ERROR` is
printed if no model is found.
If a model is found, it will look like:

----
SAT: {
  <decl>*
}
----

where each `<decl>` is either:

type declaration:: of the form `type <id> = {<dom_elt>*}.`,
  a finite type containing special constants called _domain elements_
  that are all distinct. Every term of this type is mapped, in the
  model, to one of these domain elements. Domain elements are
  identifiers starting with `$`.
value definition:: of the form `val term := term.`, defines the
  left-hand side term to be equal to the right-hand side term.

== S-expression based Syntax (`-o sexp`)

A simple S-expression based syntax for easy parsing by a tool.
A model looks like this:

----
(SAT
 ((type a ($a_0 $a_1))
  (val ys (Cons $a_1 Nil))
  (val xs (Cons $a_0 Nil))))
----

So it is isomorphic to the native syntax but uses S-expressions everywhere.
The exact formatting of terms in S-expressions should look roughly like TIP
but is not yet documented.

== TPTP syntax (`-o tptp`)

Loosely based on http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/TPTP/QuickGuide/FiniteInterpretations.html
but not thoroughly tested.


== Design Issues

=== Syntax

The current output looks like an S-expression. For CVC4, such an output format
makes a lot of sense, because SMT-LIB input is also a list of S-expressions
(or something very similar). But for Nunchaku, this feels outlandish.
Something like

----
val elem := {@elem_1, @elem_2}.
----

for uninterpreted types and

----
val append := fun ($xs : list). fun ($ys : list). blah_blah.
----

for terms would feel more natural (and wouldn't be harded to parse). You could
even go further and really use the input syntax, e.g.

----
datatype elem = @elem_1 | @elem_2.
rec append : list -> list -> list :=
  append $xs $ys = blah_blah.
----

(even if "elem" is an uninterpreted type, i.e., "val elem : type" in the input
problem, and "append" is specified by something else than "rec"). The
advantage of this scheme is that the output syntax is a subset of the input
syntax. And one could in principle take the input file, replace the
declaration of "elem" and the definition of "append" with the model output,
rerun Nunchaku, and get SAT again (modulo little syntactic issues like "?__",
but even there I have some ideas [*]).

Oh, and the types should definitely come before the terms.

[*] In essence, ?__ could be a special "fail" function, for which a guard
ensures that it is never called. (You can think of it as being a function
whose alpha type is constrained to be always empty.) This would be useful in
other contexts in the input language. I wanted to bring this up at some point.
No hurry, but it would be a nice feature. Other possible names for "?__" (in
the input language) would be "fail" or "abort" or "avoid" or "block" or
"bottom".

=== Presentation of Functions

Irrespective of the above syntactic decision, a good question is how to
present functions. There's the "if then else" scheme, with equals and
conjunctions:

----
append = fun $xs : list. fun $ys : list.
  if $xs = Cons @uc_a_1 Nil && $ys = Cons @uc_a_0 Nil then
    Cons @uc_a_1 (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil)
  else if $xs = Cons @uc_a_0 Nil && $ys = Cons @uc_a_1 Nil then
    Cons @uc_a_0 (Cons @uc_a_1 Nil)
  else if $xs = Nil && $ys = Cons @uc_a_0 Nil then
    Cons @uc_a_0 Nil
  else if $xs = Nil && $ys = Cons @uc_a_1 Nil then
    Cons @uc_a_1 Nil
  else
    ?__ $xs $ys
----

Then there's the ML-style tabular syntax, which has the definite advantage of
compactness and readability. Also notice how the unspecified case does not
have to be specified explicitly.

----
append (Cons @uc_a_1 Nil) (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil) = Cons @uc_a_1 (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil)
append (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil) (Cons @uc_a_1 Nil) = Cons @uc_a_0 (Cons @uc_a_1 Nil)
append Nil (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil) = Cons @uc_a_0 Nil
append Nil (Cons @uc_a_1 Nil) = Cons @uc_a_1 Nil
----

The main disadvantages are:

1. It does not really scale up to higher-order logic. I.e. at some point,
we'll need to write out functions "(fun $xs. fun $ys. if ...)" anyway.

2. It is less uniform and requires more interfacing for each frontend.

So the "if then else" scheme is probably the best one. Also, users will rarely
inspect the model of functions (e.g. nobody would look at the model of
"append" in practice, unless they suspect a bug), except when these functions
are free variables in the goal (for higher-order problems).

== Self-Contained or Not?

Should the output be self-contained -- i.e., should it repeat declarations
from the input, e.g. "data"? Repeating is what TSTP and CVC4 do. This can be
interesting because then the output is potentially itself an input file, which
is useful for testing (checking that the model is indeed a model by rerunning
Nunchaku on the output) and connecting tools together. But it also means more
clutter.

== Generated Names

We need to do something about the names of atoms and the names of bound
variables. For atoms, there should be a clear naming convention enforced by
Nunchaku, irrespective of what CVC4 does. For example, if an uninterpreted
type is called "elem", the atoms might be called "@elem_1", "@elem_2", ...,
"@elem_N" or "elem@0", "elem@1", ..., "elem@N-1". Right now, CVC4 sometimes
uses the name of some constant, and sometimes it generates some identifiers.

For bound variables, aggressive renaming is also the way to go. Perhaps the
same convention as for atoms can be used, but with, say, "$" instead of "@".

== Current Situation

The current output is broken in some cases. Take "bugs/rec_model.nun":

----
val a : type.

data list :=
  Nil
| Cons a list.

rec append : list -> list -> list :=
  forall (zs : list). append Nil zs = zs;
  forall (x : a) (ws : list) (zs : list). append (Cons x ws) zs = Cons x (append ws zs).

val xs : list.
val ys : list.

goal ~ (append xs ys = append ys xs).
----

Nunchaku's output is currently

----
SAT:

        ((ys Cons @uc_a_1 Nil)

     (types ((a {@uc_a_1, @uc_a_0})))
  ))
----

The symbols @uc_G_append_3 etc. have no business in there.

The model given by CVC4 looks like this:

----
(define-fun __nun_card_witness_1 () G_append @uc_G_append_0)
(define-fun append (($x1 list) ($x2 list)) list (ite (and (= $x1 (Cons @uc_a_1 (Cons @uc_a_0 (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil)))) (= $x2 (Cons @uc_a_1 Nil))) (Cons @uc_a_0 (Cons @uc_a_0 (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil))) (ite (and (= $x1 (Cons @uc_a_1 (Cons @uc_a_0 (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil)))) (= $x2 (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil))) (Cons @uc_a_2 (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil)) (ite (and (= $x1 (Cons @uc_a_1 Nil)) (= $x2 (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil))) (Cons @uc_a_1 (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil)) (ite (and (= $x1 Nil) (= $x2 (Cons @uc_a_1 Nil))) (Cons @uc_a_1 Nil) (ite (and (= $x1 Nil) (= $x2 (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil))) (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil) (Cons @uc_a_0 (Cons @uc_a_1 Nil))))))))
(define-fun proj_G_append_0 (($x1 G_append)) list (ite (= @uc_G_append_3 $x1) Nil (ite (= @uc_G_append_2 $x1) Nil (ite (= @uc_G_append_1 $x1) (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil) (Cons @uc_a_1 Nil)))))
(define-fun proj_G_append_1 (($x1 G_append)) list (ite (= @uc_G_append_1 $x1) (Cons @uc_a_1 Nil) (ite (= @uc_G_append_3 $x1) (Cons @uc_a_1 Nil) (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil))))
(define-fun ys () list (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil))
(define-fun xs () list (Cons @uc_a_1 Nil))
)
----

Once we filter out "proj_G_append_*", this is almost already a good model for
Nunchaku, except that we need to massage the "append" model so that it states
clearly for all legal arguments what the value is and "?__" otherwise. Looking
at "proj_G_append_*", we see the different legal tuples of arguments:

----
@uc_G_append_0 = (Cons @uc_a_1 Nil, Cons @uc_a_0 Nil)
@uc_G_append_1 = (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil, Cons @uc_a_1 Nil)
@uc_G_append_2 = (Nil, Cons @uc_a_0 Nil)
@uc_G_append_3 = (Nil, Cons @uc_a_1 Nil)
----

So we already know that the "append" model is going to be of the form

----
append = fun $xs : list. fun $ys : list.
  if $xs = X1 && $ys = Y1 then
    Z1
  else if $xs = X2 && $ys = Y2 then
    Z2
  else if $xs = X3 && $ys = Y3 then
    Z3
  else if $xs = X4 && $ys = Y4 then
    Z4
  else
    ?__ $xs $ys
----

Notice the arguments to "?__": They indicate the dependency of the unspecified
value on its arguments. (One of my regrets with Nitpick is that I used the
"..." notation for lots of things, resulting in an unclear notion of partial
model.)

Now we plug in the values from the "@uc_G_append_*" tuples given above for the
"Xs" and "Ys":

----
append = fun $xs : list. fun $ys : list.
  if $xs = Cons @uc_a_1 Nil && $ys = Cons @uc_a_0 Nil then
    Z1
  else if $xs = Cons @uc_a_0 Nil && $ys = Cons @uc_a_1 Nil then
    Z2
  else if $xs = Nil && $ys = Cons @uc_a_0 Nil then
    Z3
  else if $xs = Nil && $ys = Cons @uc_a_1 Nil then
    Z4
  else
    ?__ $xs $ys
----

Now we perform a lookup in the model of "append" generated by CVC4. The model
looks like this (with better indentation than above):

----
append = fun $x1 : list. fun $x2 : list.
  ite (and (= $x1 (Cons @uc_a_1 (Cons @uc_a_0 (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil)))) (= $x2 (Cons @uc_a_1 Nil)))
    (Cons @uc_a_0 (Cons @uc_a_0 (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil)))
    (ite (and (= $x1 (Cons @uc_a_1 (Cons @uc_a_0 (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil)))) (= $x2 (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil)))
      (Cons @uc_a_2 (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil))
      (ite (and (= $x1 (Cons @uc_a_1 Nil)) (= $x2 (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil)))
        (Cons @uc_a_1 (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil))
        (ite (and (= $x1 Nil) (= $x2 (Cons @uc_a_1 Nil)))
          (Cons @uc_a_1 Nil)
          (ite (and (= $x1 Nil) (= $x2 (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil)))
            (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil)
            (Cons @uc_a_0 (Cons @uc_a_1 Nil))))))))
----

Notice that the first two branches are completely superfluous -- they're pure
junk. We never look these up, so that's OK. Filling in the values, we get:

----
append = fun $xs : list. fun $ys : list.
  if $xs = Cons @uc_a_1 Nil && $ys = Cons @uc_a_0 Nil then
    Cons @uc_a_1 (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil)   (* 3rd case above *)
  else if $xs = Cons @uc_a_0 Nil && $ys = Cons @uc_a_1 Nil then
    Cons @uc_a_0 (Cons @uc_a_1 Nil)   (* 6th case above)
  else if $xs = Nil && $ys = Cons @uc_a_0 Nil then
    Cons @uc_a_0 Nil   (* 5th case above *)
  else if $xs = Nil && $ys = Cons @uc_a_1 Nil then
    Cons @uc_a_1 Nil   (* 4th case above *)
  else
    ?__ $xs $ys
----

If cases are identical (whether or not they are consecutive), they should be
merged into one condition. E.g.:

----
append = fun $xs : list. fun $ys : list.
  if $xs = Nil && $ys = Cons @uc_a_0 Nil ||
     $xs = Cons @uc_a_0 Nil && $ys = Nil then
    Cons @uc_a_1 (Cons @uc_a_0 Nil)
  else
    ...
----

In the above, I have indented "if then else" chains in a flat fashion, which
is my favorite style. But I don't mind too much if Nunchaku's output indents
differently (since few users will be exposed directly to it).
